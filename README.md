### Important:

Recently, 4anime has changed their URL format & blocked multiple downloads, therefore the generator doesn't work anymore.  
Still, stick around and have a look at the code.

## Purpose

* The Web App/python script can generate download links for anime hosted on [4anime](https://4anime.to/).
* The generated links can be copied to a text file and batch dowloaded using a download manager. (IDM,FDM, etc)
