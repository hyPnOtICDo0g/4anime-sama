## Usage


### [Web App!](https://hypnoticdo0g.github.io/4Anime-sama/) ðŸ‘ˆ
* Enter the link to the First Episode and the Start & End numbers of the Episode whose links you want to generate.
* The links will be automatically generated & you can either navigate to the links of the induvidual episodes or download a text file containing the links.

### Alternative (using the python script)


* Clone the [repo](https://github.com/hyPnOtICDo0g/4anime-sama) to your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/hyPnOtICDo0g/4anime-sama.git
```  
* Navigate to the repo folder & look for the python script.
```
cd 4anime-sama
```
* Excecute the following command to run the script.
```
python 4anime.py
```
* Now you will get a prompt which means the script is running.
* Enter the link to the First Episode and the Start & End numbers of the Episode whose links you want to generate.
* The script will now output the links of the Episodes you requested for.

### Advanced script
* Create a file (say in.txt) that has the link to Episode 1 and the numbers of the Start and End Episodes you want. 
* Format:
    ```
    <link>
    <Start Episode number>
    <End Episode number>
    ```
   e.g.  
    ```
   https://storage.googleapis.com/linear-theater-254209.appspot.com/v5.4animu.me/Naruto/Naruto-Episode-1-1080p.mp4  
    1  
    10
     ```
* Execute the command
```
python 4anime-auto.py > out.txt < in.txt
```
* The generated links will now be stored in the file out.txt that can be used in the below mentioned Download Managers.
    
## Downloading
   * Using the python script: Copy the generated links (output) into a text file & save it.
   * Using the Web App: Generate the links and download the text file from the Web App. 
   * They can be batch downloaded using a Download Manager.
  
        #### Download Managers:
        * Windows: [IDM](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/download.html) / [FDM](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/download.htm) / [uGet](https://ugetdm.com/downloads/windows/)
        * MAC: [FDM](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/download-fdm-for-mac.htm)
        * Linux: [uGet](https://ugetdm.com/downloads/#linux-distributions)

## Issues
* There may be a couple exceptions, but I've found only one anime so far which changes the URL format in-between the episodes. The problem lies with the source so until I figure out a workaround, please open an issue or report the anime name in the comments in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScriptSwap/comments/fu54ch/made_a_python_script_for_downloading_anime_from/). Instructions to download if the above ever happens lies in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/hyPnOtICDo0g/bfa2c6194737d8b4c6df89c89b91d895).
* If you ever encounter any other errors then navigate to the above gist.
* After feeding the Download Manager with the text file, queue your downloads to 2-3 videos or it may result in a 503 error, as the website doesn't allow a single ip to download multiple files at one go.
