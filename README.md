### Alternative (using the python script)

```
python 4anime.py
```

* Enter the link to the First Episode and the Start & End numbers of the Episode whose links you want to generate.
* The script will now output the links of the Episodes you requested for.

### Advanced script
* Create a file (say in.txt) that has the link to Episode 1 and the numbers of the Start and End Episodes you want. 
* Format:
    ```
    <link>
    <Start Episode number>
    <End Episode number>
    ```
   e.g.  
    ```
   https://storage.googleapis.com/linear-theater-254209.appspot.com/v5.4animu.me/Naruto/Naruto-Episode-1-1080p.mp4  
    1  
    10
     ```
* Execute the command
```
python 4anime-auto.py > out.txt < in.txt
```
* The generated links will now be stored in the file out.txt that can be used in the below mentioned Download Managers.
    
## Downloading
   * Using the python script: Copy the generated links (output) into a text file & save it.
   * Using the Web App: Generate the links and download the text file from the Web App. 
   * They can be batch downloaded using a Download Manager.
  
        #### Download Managers:
        * Windows: [IDM](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/download.html) / [FDM](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/download.htm) / [uGet](https://ugetdm.com/downloads/windows/)
        * MAC: [FDM](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/download-fdm-for-mac.htm)
        * Linux: [uGet](https://ugetdm.com/downloads/#linux-distributions)

## Issues
* After feeding the Download Manager with the text file, queue your downloads to 2-3 videos or it may result in a 503 error, as the website doesn't allow a single ip to download multiple files at one go.
* There are a few anime whose 2-9th episodes give a 404 error when downloaded. Therfore, add a prefix **0** to the 2-9 episodes in the links.
